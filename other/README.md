In our robotics circle: RoboLab, we not only participate in robot t contests such as WRO, but also present our research results in international conferences and academic meetings.
We aim to win the contests, but we also disseminate the mechatronics technology and knowledge we have acquired.
We have presented papers on our robots and ideas for products at the WRO, as well as on our fabrication methods and programming. The research papers we have presented are as follows

1.  Masanori TAKANO, Koichi MURO, Yuta FUKUSHIMA, Gai KANEDA, Yuichi HASUDA, Practice and Effects of Manufacturing Education through the Challenge to Testing Skill Proficiency of Machining at Universities, 4th International Symposium on Engineering and Technology Innovation（ISBENS2023） 107-117 2023
2.  Norito NIKI , Justin Lee , Koichi MURO, Yuta FUKUSHIMA and Yuichi HASUDA, Development of Teaching Materials on Autonomous Driving of robots using Deep Learning, 8th International Scientific Conference on Engineering and Applied Sciences 2023
